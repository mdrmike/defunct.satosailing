## Access our shared folder

Start by accessing the club :file_folder: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7xS-e7S036gT0QzNGpURHl4LTA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Shared folder</a>. This folder provides full read, edit, and create access to all the shared documents about the club. They are updated often, by all parents & sailors.  We share info about the club, coordinate carpooling to practice and regattas, coordinate fund-raising activities, and more!
