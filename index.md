## Access our shared folder

Start by accessing the club :file_folder:  [shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7xS-e7S036gT0QzNGpURHl4LTA). This folder provides full read/edit access to all the shared documents about the club. We share info about the club, coordinate carpooling to practice and regattas, coordinate fundraising activities, and more!

####  Optional

**Note** If you're accessing our shared folder from your phone or tablet, everything works using a web browser on any device (and no accounts are required).  However, there is also an option to install the apps _Google Docs_ and _Google Sheets_ which may make it even easier to edit. They are unessesary, but it gives you more options.
