At practice on Friday I spoke with ABYC coach Mark Ryan (Craig Ramsay, Director of Sailing Programs was unavailable).  Due to PCISA rules for a team to compete in a regatta we need to have at least two boats; a gold & silver team boat.  The current plan is to send Nikhil & Diego for Gold, and Troy & Elizabeth for silver.  Hopefully more sailors can join us since its also typical to swap crew out during a two day event â€” although fun sailing both days, it can be very long & tiring.  Suggestions on how to coordinate this trip is welcome!  [Travel Coordination Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_aak6r156h44mse531RZKZOjXVh1fIFb2djaTb_KRo0) (in shared folder)


### Logistics 

No practice Friday Oct 13 due to regatta travel.

Practice as normal on Wed Oct 11, then (possible practce on Thursday? and/or simply) prep and pack the boats to be ready to go.  Which allows a driver(s) to tow trailer(s) Thursday or Friday. 




#### Lodging 

Map listing of [Hotels near Monterey Bay Yacht Club](https://www.google.com/maps/search/hotels+near+montery+bay+yacht+club/@36.5969668,-121.8908823,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!2m4!5m3!5m2!1s2017-10-13!2i2?hl=en). Book soon, prices are up on that weekend, you might want to stay a bit further away in order to save a little.
